//  NB Changes (May 2017 - Present):
/* Changes :

2017.05.12:  NB has edited main.cpp to incorporate a single (1) type of fractionally ionizable group with parameter (alpha). This includes ability to echo (input) this new parameter (alpha) below and to call function "new assign_random_q_values" (found in Interface.cpp) using this parameter. [Preliminary studies reporting multiple groups have assumed the groups to have the same alpha values, i.e. one group is basic the other acidic and you are at pH = Mean[pKa1, pKa2].]

2017.06.05:  NB has added working area constraint functions (SHAKE_for_area & RATTLE_for_area).  Area is conserved to within a fraction of a percent with default masses = 1.0, etc.  

                2017.09.20:  SHAKE_for_area & RATTLE_for_area found to be in error, math mistake.  Only coincide

2017.06.13:  NB has added a pre-MD line below to dump the initial state in the movie file as well; it calls this timestep "-1" in the movie file due to the way the function "interface_movie" is defined.

2017.06.26:  NB is working to make the optimization dynamics a real-time study.  Because the temperature uniformly started at (.5T), an excess factor of 2 in the denominator of the standard deviation of the initial velocity distribution "p_sigma" was removed (within "functions.cpp").  The temperature now begins sufficiently close to the intended temperature (within 10% @ t = 1 step).  Energy conservation is improved after this correction. [Adding a factor of 2 in the denominator of all DOF's supplied to the thermostat also had this effect, but it seems correcting "p_sigma" - not thermostat DOF's - is the correct solution.  Some sources imply DOF's should be 3N - 1 due to constraint, however energy conservation seems to work marginally better without subtracting the constraint DOF, so subtraction may be wrong.]

2017.06.28:  NB has finished adapting the code to a real-time study (sans barostat).  The parameters that optimally conserve energy for discretizations up to (3,8) are {C = 5,  T = 1.0, Q = 0.01, M = 1.0, dt = .00001, DOF = 3N}.

2017.07.04:  NB has added a for statement allowing "assign_random_q_values" to create 5 divisions.

2017.07.08:  NB made a few trivial changes such as 1) making "total_time" now specify the number of steps to run itself rather than a function of (dt) because it would have an error if the ratio became to large and 2) eliminating the unused variable M introduced to specify vertex mass (we must keep as 1.0).  Additionally, a character flag ("annealFlag") has been added (that must be echoed after all numerical parameters) that signifies if annealing should occur ('y' or 'n').

2017.07.09:  NB is refining functionality to continue a simulation from a pre-existing off-file ("Optimized.off", must have this name). This involved adding a second character flag (that also must be echoed, after the numerical parameters and annealing flag) signifying if said off-file is to be loaded. If you use Nicholas' automated-PBS script generator, it will automatically denote the values of these flags in the cluster job name (and warn you if you are submitting a RT job that anneals).

2017.08.08:  NB has randomized the charge distribution assignment scheme (rather than using permutations as it introduces significant stripes and polar deficits in charge density & potential, though it produces similar shapes for the case tested.)  Also, I am changing the function for generation of axially distributed patches of charge (spherical caps).

2017.09.07:  NB has verified all mathematical components of the volume and area constraints.  All are correct, a factor of (1/2) is missing in the face area gradient within the "compute_neg_VGrads" function; however, adding it here causes major issues, meaning it is probably within those functions already (must check).  It is only used in bending energy calculations and (if area constrained) the "SHAKE/RATTLE_for_area" functions.  Adding (1/2) factors in the appropriate place within the "SHAKE/RATTLE_for_area" seems to be fine.
